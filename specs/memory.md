- **Primary Focus**: Voice controls optimization for mobile devices
  - Enhance VoiceControls component for better mobile interaction
  - Improve audio level visualization and feedback
  - Optimize touch targets and gesture handling
- **Secondary Focus**: Loading states and error handling improvements
  - Implement comprehensive error boundaries
  - Add loading indicators for voice processing
  - Enhance user feedback during conversation states
  - Handle network connectivity issues gracefully

### Documentation Maintenance ðŸ”„
- Keep project documentation updated with recent changes
- Maintain changelog with semantic versioning
- Update API documentation as new edge functions are added

## Next Tasks (Planned)

### Phase 3: Onboarding Experience - Testing & Refinement
- Comprehensive testing of onboarding flow across devices
- Edge case handling and validation
- User experience testing and feedback collection
- Performance optimization for voice interactions
- Accessibility testing and improvements

### Phase 4: Core Dashboard Features
- User profile management interface
- Daily session interface design and implementation
- Progress tracking and analytics dashboard
- Goal setting and management system
- Virtue collection system implementation
- Streak tracking visualization

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
- Remove test data from Onboarding.tsx (currently hardcoded for development)
- Implement proper error handling for ElevenLabs API failures
- Add comprehensive loading states throughout the application
- Optimize bundle size and performance for mobile devices

### Medium Priority
- Enhance TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Implement comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Add proper logging and monitoring for production
- Optimize database queries and indexing

### Low Priority
- Implement advanced animation system
- Add dark/light theme support
- Enhance accessibility beyond WCAG 2.1 AA
- Implement advanced caching strategies

## Key Decisions & Context

### Architecture Decisions
- **Mobile-first approach**: iPhone 14 Pro as primary target device
- **Fixed-box layouts**: Containers with internal scrolling to prevent layout shifts
- **Voice-first onboarding**: ElevenLabs integration for natural conversation flow
- **Edge function preference**: Business logic handled server-side for security and performance
- **Web-first approach**: Removed PWA constraints to focus on responsive web design

### Design Decisions
- **Glass morphism**: Semi-transparent cards with blur effects for modern aesthetic
- **Purple gradient theme**: Calming colors that promote emotional wellness
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interfaces that don't distract from the wellness journey
- **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline requirement
- **Internal scrolling**: Fixed containers with scrollable content areas for predictable layouts

### Technical Constraints
- **ElevenLabs API limits**: Rate limiting and cost considerations for voice interactions
- **Mobile performance**: Battery and network optimization requirements
- **Real-time features**: WebRTC complexity for future calling features
- **Database security**: RLS policies for all user data protection
- **No PWA complexity**: Simplified deployment and maintenance without PWA requirements

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Identified Risks
- **ElevenLabs dependency**: Single point of failure for voice interactions
- **Mobile performance**: Potential issues on older devices with voice processing
- **User onboarding complexity**: Risk of high drop-off rates during voice setup
- **Database scaling**: Potential performance issues as user base grows

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement fallback mechanisms for voice failures
- Progressive enhancement for older devices
- A/B testing for onboarding flow optimization
- Database performance monitoring and optimization
