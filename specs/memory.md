- New users: Landing ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Onboarding ‚Üí Dashboard
- Returning users: Direct to Dashboard (skip onboarding if completed)
- Check `profile.onboarding_completed` status for routing decisions
- Update onboarding completion flag after successful onboarding

**Implementation Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Update project plan with user flow requirements
2. üîÑ Modify App.tsx to implement conditional routing logic
3. ‚è≥ Ensure onboarding completion tracking works properly
4. ‚è≥ Test user flow for both new and returning users
5. ‚è≥ Update changelog with implemented changes

## Next Tasks ‚è≥

## Technical Decisions Made
- Using Supabase for backend services (auth, database, edge functions)
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- React hooks for state management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular component architecture

## Known Issues
- Service Workers not supported in StackBlitz (development only)
- PWA manifest warnings (development environment)
- Need to implement proper error handling for auth state changes

## Architecture Notes
- Authentication state managed through useAuth hook
- Database operations abstracted through DatabaseService class
- Protected routes ensure authenticated access
- Profile and onboarding data linked through foreign keys
- RLS policies ensure data security and user isolation
