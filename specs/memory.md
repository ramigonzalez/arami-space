- **Auth Component Enhancement**: Added proper redirect logic after successful authentication
  - Implemented useAuth hook integration in Auth.tsx
  - Added automatic navigation to appropriate page based on onboarding status

  - Phone verification â†’ Automatic redirect to /onboarding or /dashboard
  - Magic link â†’ Automatic redirect to /onboarding or /dashboard
  - No more getting stuck on auth page after successful authentication

### Project Scope Refinement âœ…

- **PWA Feature Removal**: Removed Progressive Web App functionality from project scope
  - Simplified to responsive web application approach
  - Updated all project documentation to reflect scope change
  - Focused on mobile-first responsive design without PWA constraints

### Phase 3: Complete Authentication Flow Fix âœ… **MAJOR MILESTONE**

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Complete resolution of email confirmation redirect issues
  - **Problem**: After email confirmation, new users were landing on root URL (/#) showing landing page while logged in
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. AuthCallback.tsx was hardcoding redirects to /dashboard regardless of onboarding status
    2. Email signup was missing emailRedirectTo configuration, causing Supabase to redirect to root instead of callback
    3. Email template was using {{ .SiteURL }} instead of {{ .RedirectTo }} causing malformed URLs
    4. Multi-tab authentication conflicts when clicking email links
  - **Complete Solution**: Three-part fix implemented:
    - **Part 1**: Updated AuthCallback component with smart redirect logic
      - Integrated useAuth hook to access user profile and onboarding status
      - Added proper state management to wait for auth initialization
      - Implemented conditional redirect based on onboarding_completed flag
      - Added multi-tab authentication handling for already-authenticated users
    - **Part 2**: Fixed email signup configuration
      - Added `emailRedirectTo: /auth/callback` to signUpWithEmail function
      - Email confirmation links now properly redirect to callback route
      - Ensures all auth methods use consistent callback URL pattern
    - **Part 3**: Updated Supabase email template configuration
      - Changed email template from {{ .SiteURL }} to {{ .RedirectTo }}
      - Email confirmation links now properly formatted with callback parameters
      - Fixed malformed URLs ending with just "#"
  - **Impact**: New users now have seamless flow: signup â†’ email confirmation â†’ callback â†’ onboarding
  - **Result**: Authentication flow is now robust and handles all edge cases properly

### Phase 3: Landing Page Header Refactor âœ…

- **UI/UX Improvement**: Removed header elements from landing page for cleaner presentation
  - **Removed**: "Arami Space" header bar that was showing on all pages
  - **Removed**: Bolt.new badge from top-right corner
  - **Made header conditional**: Header now only appears for authenticated users
  - **Impact**: Landing page now has a cleaner, more focused presentation without distracting header elements
  - **Maintained functionality**: Header still appears on dashboard and onboarding pages where it's needed

## Current Tasks (In Progress)

### Phase 3: Onboarding Experience - Voice Controls & Error Handling ðŸ”„

- **Primary Focus**: Voice controls optimization for mobile devices

## Next Tasks (Planned)

### Phase 3: Onboarding Experience - Testing & Refinement

- Comprehensive testing of onboarding flow across devices
- Edge case handling and validation
- User experience testing and feedback collection
- Performance optimization for voice interactions
- Accessibility testing and improvements

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority

- Remove test data from Onboarding.tsx (currently hardcoded for development)
- Implement proper error handling for ElevenLabs API failures
- Add comprehensive loading states throughout the application
- Optimize bundle size and performance for mobile devices

### Medium Priority

- Enhance TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Implement comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Add proper logging and monitoring for production
- Optimize database queries and indexing

### Low Priority

- Implement advanced animation system
- Add dark/light theme support
- Enhance accessibility beyond WCAG 2.1 AA
- Implement advanced caching strategies

## Key Decisions & Context

### Architecture Decisions

- **Mobile-first approach**: iPhone 14 Pro as primary target device
- **Fixed-box layouts**: Containers with internal scrolling to prevent layout shifts
- **Voice-first onboarding**: ElevenLabs integration for natural conversation flow
- **Edge function preference**: Business logic handled server-side for security and performance
- **Web-first approach**: Removed PWA constraints to focus on responsive web design

### Design Decisions

- **Glass morphism**: Semi-transparent cards with blur effects for modern aesthetic
- **Purple gradient theme**: Calming colors that promote emotional wellness
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interfaces that don't distract from the wellness journey
- **Accessibility first**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as baseline requirement
- **Internal scrolling**: Fixed containers with scrollable content areas for predictable layouts

### Technical Constraints

- **ElevenLabs API limits**: Rate limiting and cost considerations for voice interactions
- **Mobile performance**: Battery and network optimization requirements
- **Real-time features**: WebRTC complexity for future calling features
- **Database security**: RLS policies for all user data protection
- **No PWA complexity**: Simplified deployment and maintenance without PWA requirements

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers

- None identified at this time

### Identified Risks

- **ElevenLabs dependency**: Single point of failure for voice interactions
- **Mobile performance**: Potential issues on older devices with voice processing
- **User onboarding complexity**: Risk of high drop-off rates during voice setup
- **Database scaling**: Potential performance issues as user base grows

### Mitigation Strategies

- Implement fallback mechanisms for voice failures
- Progressive enhancement for older devices
- A/B testing for onboarding flow optimization
- Database performance monitoring and optimization
