# Position Statement

Great, Ramiro. Based on the content you wrote in the two manual records, here's the structured and clear compilation of your GoToMarket Statement, following the format:

---

## ✅ **What I'm Building**

I'm building an **emotional growth mentor with AI** — a virtual _accountability_ partner that listens to you, understands you, and helps you stay focused on your dreams and goals.  
It's a **conversational platform with personalized AI avatars** that accompanies you daily, reminds you of what matters, and talks to you **without judgment**, at your own pace.  
The interaction adapts to your behavioral profile (like DISC and Enneagram) and uses reflection methods like the **Socratic method**, so that answers emerge from within you.

---

## 🎯 **To Help**

For **people who feel alone in their personal and professional evolution journey**, who:

- don't have anyone to share their most ambitious goals with for fear of judgment,
- only count on family support (who often don't understand their objectives),
- don't have a partner, or the partner doesn't offer real support,
- or still, **haven't found a community where they feel truly understood**.

---

## ❌ **With**

These people face the **lack of emotional and strategic support in their daily lives**, and feel that:

- they are **alone in their projects and dreams**,
- they don't have someone who **reminds them of what matters**,
- and they don't find motivation to stay consistent without this support.

---

## 📄 **Strong paragraph for Landing Page**

> You don't need an expensive coach or to expose yourself on social media to stay focused on your evolution. The Voice Mentor is your emotional growth partner with AI — an intelligent avatar that listens to you with empathy, understands your behavioral profile and helps keep your goals alive every day. Whether you're a solitary creative mind, someone without family support or just tired of carrying goals alone, here you find welcome, clarity and continuous motivation. No judgment. Just direction.

---

## 🎤 **Modular paragraph for 30-second Pitch**

> We're creating a growth mentor with AI, focused on people who feel alone in achieving their goals.  
> It's an app with an intelligent avatar that talks to you daily, understands your emotions and DISC/Enneagram profile, and helps you stay focused on your goals.  
> Unlike a traditional coach, it doesn't judge, doesn't tell you what to do — it just reminds you of what matters.  
> It's company, clarity and consistency — in your time, your way.

---

## 🧲 AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

- **Attention:**  
   If you feel you're always alone in your goals — you're not the only one.
- **Interest:**  
   Voice Mentor is an app with emotional AI that truly listens to you, understands your way of thinking and helps you stay focused without judgments.
- **Desire:**  
   Imagine having a partner who reminds you of your dreams every day, gives you clarity, and adapts everything to your way of functioning.
- **Action:**  
   Start your journey today with someone who really understands you. No coach, no exposure. Just you and your evolution.

---

## 🧩 SPIN (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need)

- **Situation:**  
   Many people have big goals, but feel alone in achieving them.
- **Problem:**  
   They don't have anyone to share their plans with for fear of being judged or misunderstood.
- **Implication:**  
   This leads to procrastination, giving up and feelings of stagnation, even having potential and will.
- **Need:**  
   With Voice Mentor, you gain an AI partner that listens to you, reminds you of what matters, and guides you without pressure — just direction.

---

## 🎬 StoryBrand (Character, Problem, Guide, Plan, Call to Action, Success)

- **Character:**  
   A person with big dreams, but without daily emotional or strategic support.
- **Problem:**  
   Feels alone, misunderstood and without consistency to maintain focus.
- **Guide:**  
   Voice Mentor appears as an empathetic virtual mentor, who understands your profile and listens to you every day.
- **Plan:**  
   Use the app for emotional check-ins, reflections and goal reinforcement aligned with your DISC and Enneagram profile.
- **Call to action:**  
   Start now with 1 daily conversation and see your clarity and consistency grow.
- **Success:**  
   You gain real motivation, emotional consistency and focus on your goals — even without depending on anyone.

---

## 💡 Extra: "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD)

> When I'm struggling to maintain consistency in my projects and don't have anyone to share my goals with,  
> I want a mentor who understands me emotionally and helps me remember what's important,  
> so I don't give up on what I want because I feel alone.

What do we prioritize in the next step?
