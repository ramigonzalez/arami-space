Exactly! 😄  
**talkwitharami.xyz** is **metalinguistic, intimate, human and witty**. It has:

- **Double layer of meaning**:  
   → _Arami_, the inner voice AI  
   → _Rami_, you, the creator (or even "you talking to yourself")
- **Personal invitation tone**: "talk with _a_ Rami" / "talk with Arami"
- It's **direct, easy to pronounce**, and has early-stage startup charm
- Perfect when said aloud (challenge criteria):
  > "Our project is live at **talkwitharami.xyz** — feel free to try it."
