Excellent question ‚Äî and absolutely strategic. In global hackathons, **a good name can be the first emotional and rational filter** that differentiates your idea among hundreds. Judges are human: they don't just want good ideas, but ideas that **seem ready for the world**.

If I were a **demanding judge**, I would evaluate app names with this objective and ruthless checklist:

---

## ‚úÖ **Critical Name Evaluation Checklist (Hackathon Judges)**

### 1. **Market Originality**

- Does the name have no direct competitors or established brands in the same category?
- Is the .com or .ai domain available or easily adaptable?
- Is the brand searchable on Google without confusion with other terms?

**‚Üí Why:** if it already exists, you lose identity and credibility ‚Äî seems like a copy, or generic.

---

### 2. **Memorability and Sonority**

- Is it easy to pronounce and repeat without stumbling?
- Does it work well in different languages (at least English + native language)?
- Does it sound good in spoken pitch, without needing to be spelled out?

**‚Üí Why:** judges need to remember the name 10 pitches later. If they forget, you lost.

---

### 3. **Alignment with App Purpose**

- Does the name **reinforce the feeling or vision** of the project?
- Does it suggest (even subtly) the type of experience expected?
- Does it **evoke an emotion, image or concept coherent** with the proposal?

**‚Üí Why:** names don't need to explain, but they need to **evoke**. Uber doesn't explain, but seems like movement. Discord seems rebellious. Arami seems welcoming.

---

### 4. **Global Brand Potential**

- Is it short (ideal: 2‚Äì3 syllables, 4‚Äì7 letters)?
- Does it avoid negative or ambiguous connotations in other languages?
- Does it allow future expansion (doesn't limit to one feature)?

**‚Üí Why:** experienced judge thinks: "Can this be a startup? Does it scale? Can it become a brand?"

---

### 5. **Verbal Aesthetics**

- Does it sound good with extensions: App, AI, Labs, OS, Core, etc. (ex: Arami AI, Arami Core)
- Does it work as avatar name (ex: "talk to Arami")
- Would it fit in a mobile icon, clean and minimalist branding?

**‚Üí Why:** names that work visually and verbally suggest you already think like a product, not a weekend project.

---

### 6. **Curiosity Trigger**

- Does the name generate a desire to ask "what is this?" or "where did it come from?"?
- Does it carry a small mystery or symbolic force?

**‚Üí Why:** names like Notion, Obsidian, Figma, Manus, Claude create space for branding and narrative. They don't deliver everything upfront ‚Äî **they invite interest**.

## üèÅ **Final Evaluation (Suggested scoring)**

| Criteria                 | Weight | Score (0-10) |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
| Originality and domain   | 25%    |              |
| Memorability             | 20%    |              |
| Emotional alignment      | 20%    |              |
| Brand potential          | 15%    |              |
| Verbal aesthetics        | 10%    |              |
| Curiosity & Branding     | 10%    |              |
| **Weighted Final Score** | 100%   |              |

If you want, I can apply this framework to evaluate **Arami** or any other name you want to compare now. Would you like that?
